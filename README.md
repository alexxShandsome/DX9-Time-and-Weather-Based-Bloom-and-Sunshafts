<br>

This addon is tested only in DirectX 9, never tried it myself in DirectX 10 or 11 yet but it will work because this addons controls the hidden settings inside STALKER Anomaly.
* r2_ls_bloom_fast
* r2_ls_bloom_kernel_g
* r2_ls_bloom_kernel_scale
* r2_ls_bloom_threshold
* r2_sunshafts_mode

For better experience, I recommend to use it with:
* TheMrDemonized's "[Michikos Weather Revamp Revised](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/michikos-weather-revamp-revised)"
* TheMrDemonized's "[Dynamic Time-based Tonemap Extended](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/dynamic-time-based-tonemap-extended)"
